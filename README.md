# Umbrella for Sitecore JSS

Welcome to the [Umbrella for Sitecore JSS](https://github.com/macaw-interactive/react-jss-typescript-starter) project. **Umbrella for Sitecore JSS** is our vision on how a website should be developed and hosted while using Sitecore as a headless CMS.

See a running example of this starter at https://react-jss-typescript-starter-develop.azurewebsites.net.

# The default branch

Currently the default branch is the `develop` branch because the project is in full development. When we reach a more stable situation we will merge the `develop` branch into the `master`. At that moment the `master` branch will become the default branch.

# Documentation

The documentation can be found at [./public/documentation/README.md](./public/documentation/README.md) so we can use it inthe demo website.
