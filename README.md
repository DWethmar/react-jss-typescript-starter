# react-jss-typescript-starter

The JSS React Starter Application configured for TypeScript based development.
Provides a front-end node server.

Run the node server in development mode:

`npm run serve`

Production mode version will be built with:

`npm run build`

Execute from the folder `build.server` using `node index.js`.

The `index.js` script contains all required code (server bundle with all components is embeded).

Currently the node server runs in connected mode. Disconnected mode will come soon.
